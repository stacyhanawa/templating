	<p><h3>Creative Thinker | Problem Solver | Team Player</h3><p>
	<br>
	<br>
	As a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, I enjoy bringing both of my passions for architecture and sustainable design to the table. As a Bay Area native, I am fortunate to have grown up in such a diverse environment, constantly inspired to remain curious and to continue learning about the industry. As a project designer, I contribute to all phases of the design, from initial programming to construction documents.

<p><em>“I would like to tap into this background of mine and contribute back to my local community, and have it serve as a stepping stone to becoming more involved in communities I have not previously been exposed to.”</em></p>

I enjoy the hands-on nature of design, the process of refining aesthetics, and coming up with creative solutions, striving to create architecture that is an interplay of these various aspects of design.
